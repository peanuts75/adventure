These areas have a title, a subtitle and a description as manditory key-value pairs, any others use the key as the input required to access that area and the value is the number of the room that the input will take you to.\n\nNote that these pairs, or links, are area dependent; this means that saying 'next' in one room might have no effect in another room. There are a couple of other inputs that can be used in every room though, and they'll always have the same result regardless of the room you're in when you type."
